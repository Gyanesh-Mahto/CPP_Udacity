Inheritence
In our everyday life, we tend to divide things into groups, based on their shared characteristics. Here are some groups that you have probably used yourself: electronics, tools, vehicles, or plants.

Sometimes these groups have hierarchies. For example, computers and smartphones are both types of electronics, but computers and smartphones are also groups in and of themselves. You can imagine a tree with "electronics" at the top, and "computers" and "smartphones" each as children of the "electronics" node.
